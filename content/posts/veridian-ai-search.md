## Component Breakdown

### Injected Frontend Widget

- Intercepts search input
- Sends query to Veridian backend
- Displays enhanced results in place or alongside native search

### Intent Parser (LLM)

- Converts natural language into structured search goals
- Determines whether the query is for comparison, filter, recommendation, etc.

### Search Plan Generator

- Translates intent into one or more search actions:
  - Single query: keyword
  - Multi-query: compare multiple products
  - Filtered query: map query to product tags or metadata

### Plan Executor
