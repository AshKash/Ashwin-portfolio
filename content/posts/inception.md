# Ashwin Kashyap – AI Strategy & Engineering Consultant

## Transforming Businesses Through AI

I help small businesses unlock the power of AI – from idea to deployment. With over 20 years of experience building real-world, scalable products at companies like Apple, Meta, and as a startup founder, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise and business acumen to every project.

## My Approach

I believe in making AI accessible and practical for businesses of all sizes. My approach combines:

- **Deep Technical Expertise**: From search systems to personalization engines, I've built AI solutions used by millions
- **Product Thinking**: Focus on solving real business problems, not just implementing technology
- **Startup Agility**: Move fast, validate quickly, and iterate based on results
- **Clear Communication**: Break down complex AI concepts into actionable strategies

## Services

I work directly with founders and business owners to:

- **Develop AI Strategy**: Create a roadmap aligned with your business goals
- **Identify High-Impact Use Cases**: Focus on areas like personalization, automation, and insights
- **Build Lightweight Prototypes**: Validate feasibility and ROI before full implementation
- **Deliver Production Solutions**: Collaborate with your team or vendors to bring ideas to life
- **Empower Your Team**: Provide practical knowledge to sustain your AI initiatives

## Experience & Expertise

- **AI Leadership at Scale**: 
  - Led ML development at Apple for predictive search and App Clip suggestions
  - Improved ad reliability at Meta with robust pre-processing pipelines
  - Inventor on multiple patents in AI and ML

- **Startup Founder & CTO**: 
  - Built a Shazam-like real-time content recognition system
  - Led a 15-person team from concept to product
  - Experience across the full tech stack

- **Full-Stack Perspective**: 
  - Client infrastructure
  - Cloud ML systems
  - Feature engineering pipelines
  - Edge computing and personalization

## Ideal Clients

I work best with:

- Brick-and-mortar businesses looking to automate or personalize customer interactions
- SMBs with proprietary data but no AI expertise
- Founders exploring how AI can differentiate their product or service
- Enterprises outside of tech ready to take a practical first step into AI
