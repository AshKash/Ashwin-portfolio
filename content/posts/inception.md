# Ashwin Kashyap – AI Strategy & Engineering Consultant

Helping small businesses unlock the power of AI – from idea to deployment.

## 👋 Inception

I'm an AI and machine learning leader with over 20 years of experience building real-world, scalable products at companies like Apple, Meta, and a startup I co-founded. I've led cross-functional teams, architected search and personalization systems, and shipped AI-powered experiences used by millions. Now, I'm focused on helping small businesses – especially those outside of the tech industry – understand and apply AI to solve real problems.

I bring not only deep technical expertise but also product thinking, startup agility, and an ability to break down complex AI concepts into actionable strategies that deliver value.
